# MultiSignWallet
##This is the code for a smart contract called MultiSigWallet which implements a multi-signature wallet. The contract allows multiple owners to submit and confirm a transaction before it is executed. The contract has several events that are emitted when a deposit is made, a transaction is submitted, confirmed, revoked or executed. The contract has several public variables such as an array to store the owners, a mapping to check if a user is an owner, a variable to store the number of confirmations required before a transaction is executed. It also has a struct to store the transaction details, and several mappings to check the confirmations of the transaction. The contract has several modifiers to check if the transaction exists, if it is executed or confirmed, and if the user is an owner. The contract also has a constructor to initialize the contract and several functions to deposit ETH, submit, confirm, revoke and execute a transaction. The contract also has a fallback function to receive ether.
